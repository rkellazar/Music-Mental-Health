## Context
The objective of this project is to gain insights into the potential benefits of music therapy for individuals with depression by exploring the types of music genres preferred by people experiencing depression. The project aims to identify the most common music genres preferred by people with depression, explore whether certain genres are more effective in reducing symptoms, and understand the relationship between music and mood in individuals with depression.


While the findings of this study suggest certain trends, it should be noted that the results are limited by the specific sample used and may not be representative of the entire population.
